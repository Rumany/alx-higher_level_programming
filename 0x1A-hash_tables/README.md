0x1A. C - Hash tables



Python dictionaries are implemented using hash tables. After completing this project, you'll have a better understanding of the power and simplicity of Python dictionaries.

If you're curious about how it works internally, here's a good blog post on how dictionaries are implemented in Python 2.7
